🏋️‍♂️ AI Gym Tracker — Real-Time Exercise Form Analyzer with Pose Estimation

🔍 Overview
AI Gym Tracker is an AI-powered fitness monitoring application that uses human pose estimation and machine learning to track workout repetitions and provide real-time feedback on form and posture. Designed for accessibility and ease of use, it leverages MediaPipe, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, with a clean, interactive interface built using Streamlit.

🚀 Features

🧍 Real-Time Pose Estimation using MediaPipe's holistic model

🔁 Exercise Detection & Rep Counting for bicep curls and other exercises

🧘 Form Feedback Mechanism to help correct user posture

🎥 Video Input Support for webcam or pre-recorded videos

🔊 Voice Feedback using gTTS and playsound

📊 Data Visualization (optional) with matplotlib and seaborn

🌐 Streamlit UI for interactive usage and rapid testing

🧰 Tech Stack & Libraries

Language: Python 3.9

Core ML: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Optuna

Pose Estimation: MediaPipe

Video Processing: OpenCV

Web Interface: Streamlit

Data Handling: NumPy, Pandas

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
